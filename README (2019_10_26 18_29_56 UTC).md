As you complete each lab, you should provide a description of your features and changes here.

## VR Lab: TITLE HERE
Previous XR experiences:
I've played Pokemon Go and Wizards United. They were interesting but I don't play them much due to phone space, and also Wizards is a little tedious.


## VR Lab: Lab 1
I intend to have the goal be to carry some hay to a scarecrow in order to "feed" it. I used the scarecrow and a duplicate haybale.
